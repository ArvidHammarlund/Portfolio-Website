      In 2020, I began to study at Stockholm School of Economics, 
      which until then had been a dream of mine since young. 
      Once enrolled however, it wasn't the bussiness or economics
      courses that entertained me, those that I previously would
      have expected for me to find interest in, rather it was
      the very first encounter with programming that did so
      - which was an element of the statitstic course at the school.

      Programming had until then seemed a very nische endevour
      - only suited for a specific kind of mind, and to be begun
      studied at young age with great fervour - which I deemed
      myself not to match with. This thought of mine was, I now
      realise, a very regretable disillusion, as it served as
      hindrence for me come to experiance the joy of programming
      earlier.

      Indeed, no other subject that I until then had spent time on,
      would in such a immediate way display its practical benefit,
      and at the moment on practice come to concrete embodiement
      (in a screen). It was such a refreshment from all those other
      subjects who's evident benefit remained obscure beyond the
      scope of examinations. Each hour spent truly felt that new
      abilities was created, new competitivess, and new ability
      - a craft as opposed to a mean to prove oneself.

      It is my wish that this website will come to serve as a
      stepping stone for the recovery of time lost, as well as
      a manifestetion for my newly discovered passion.
      Welcome to my website!
